You can build yourself a Linux version, idk (I didn't test to see if it works on it).

Inside `pi_libraries/Makefile`, change the `LUASRCDIR` variable to wherever the Lua src files are on your computer.  
Then, from `pi_libraries`, execute `make all` and you're good to go.

You can also use Code::Blocks to compile everything (Idk why'd you do this, tho).  
The .cbp file is included. So, just select the "all" target and build.
